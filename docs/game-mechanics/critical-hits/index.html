If the attack misses, is blocked, is reflected, or otherwise fails to land, it cannot become a critical hit.</p><p class="mt-md">Exceptions and special cases:</p><ul class="mt-md"><li>Reflected hits (back at the attacker) do not qualify for critical hits.</li><li class="mt-xs">Spells may include both an instant damage component and a damage-over-time (DoT) component:<ul class="mt-xs"><li>The instant damage component can crit.</li><li class="mt-xs">The DoT component cannot crit, and its individual damage ticks do not qualify for critical hits.</li><li class="mt-xs">If a spell has both components, a critical hit on the instant damage does not affect the DoT portion in any way.</li></ul></li><li class="mt-xs">Secondary effects like Poison and Burn can be triggered by both weapon attacks and spells. If the hit that applies the effect is a critical hit, the total damage dealt by the effect is increased. However, the individual DoT ticks from these effects do not qualify for critical hits.</li><li class="mt-xs">For multi-hit or area-of-effect (AoE) attacks, each individual hit on a target is evaluated independently for critical chance. This also includes combat arts that deal damage in pulses.</li><li class="mt-xs">Critical hits are independent of the Spell Intensity vs. Spell Resistance mechanic. A spell can critically hit and be resisted at the same time - each multiplier is applied separately to the final damage calculation.</li></ul><h2 class="mt-xl">Effects of a Critical Hit</h2><h3 class="mt-md">Weapon Attacks</h3><ul class="mt-md"><li>On a critical hit, a weapon deals its maximum base damage, ignoring the usual damage range.</li><li class="mt-xs">This maximum base damage is ultimately increased by the critical hit multiplier (+20%).</li><li class="mt-xs">The damage bonus from the governing attribute (such as Strength or Dexterity) is not affected by critical hits. As a result, critical hits with weapons still show noticeable damage variation, since the attribute bonus is based on the weapon's original damage range.</li></ul><h3 class="mt-md">Spells</h3><p class="mt-md">On a critical hit, the total spell damage, including the bonus from Intelligence, is increased by the critical hit multiplier (+20%).</p><h3 class="mt-md">Critical Hit Multiplier</h3><p class="mt-md">The critical hit multiplier is applied as a standalone multiplier during the final damage calculation. It is derived as follows:</p><p class="mt-md"><code>Multiplier = AdjustCriticalDamageFactor / 1000</code></p><p class="mt-md">Where:</p><ul class="mt-md"><li><code>AdjustCriticalDamageFactor</code> is a parameter from balance.txt. The default value in the unmodded game is 1200.</li></ul><h2 class="mt-xl">Critical Hit Chance</h2><p class="mt-md">There is a base chance to trigger a critical hit:</p><ul class="mt-md"><li>For weapon attacks, the base critical chance is equal to 1/10 of the uncapped chance to hit, which varies depending on the target.</li><li class="mt-xs">For spells, the base critical chance is a fixed 10%, since they are not affected by the chance to hit mechanic.</li></ul><p class="mt-md">The critical chance can be increased through attributes, skills, and equipment bonuses:</p><ul class="mt-md"><li>Basic attacks and <a href="/combat-arts-influenced-by-tactics-lore/">combat arts influenced by Tactics Lore</a> gain bonuses from <a href="/attributes/dexterity/">Dexterity</a> and <a href="/skills/tactics-lore/">Tactics Lore</a>.</li><li class="mt-xs"><a href="/combat-arts-influenced-by-aspect-lore/">Combat arts influenced by Aspect Lore</a> gain bonuses from <a href="/attributes/intelligence/">Intelligence</a> and the relevant <a href="/skills/aspect-lore/">Aspect Lore</a> skill.</li></ul><p class="mt-md">It is possible to exceed 100% critical chance. While this is usually pointless, it can be beneficial against enemies who have mastered the <a href="/skills/combat-reflexes/">Combat Reflexes</a> skill.</p><ul class="mt-md"><li>Combat Reflexes (mastered) reduces the attacker's total critical hit chance by a percentage. This is a relative reduction, so having a higher base value helps compensate.</li></ul></div></main><footer style="margin-top:400px;margin-bottom:32px;font-size:12px" class="text-container"><p>© 2025 Sacred 2 Compendium.
