The projectile is always fired using the right-hand weapon.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="mt-sm">When dual wielding, <a href="/combat-arts/weapon-based/">weapon-based combat arts</a> always use the right-hand weapon for every hit. This allows the left-hand weapon to be specialized purely for utility.</li><li class="mt-sm">Weapons can be equipped either by right-clicking on them or dropping them directly into a weapon slot. The first weapon you equip will always go to the right hand. The second weapon - to the left hand. If you try to equip another weapon, then you will always replace the one in the left hand. To change the right-hand weapon, it must either be dragged out from the weapon slot, or both weapons need to be removed and equipped again in the desired order.</li><li class="mt-sm">In the inventory screen, the "Weapons" section misleadingly shows that the damage of both weapons is combined.</li></ul><h2 class="mt-xl">Skill bonuses</h2><h3 class="mt-xl">Attack Value +X</h3><ul class="mt-md"><li>Increases the character's base <i>Attack Value</i> by the listed amount.</li><li class="mt-sm">Stacks additively with other sources of <i>Attack Value +X</i>.</li></ul><h3 class="mt-xl">Attack Speed +X%</h3><ul class="mt-md"><li>Increases the <i>Attack Speed</i> of basic attacks.</li><li class="mt-sm">Stacks additively with other sources of <i>Attack Speed +X%</i>.</li></ul><h3 class="mt-xl">Execution Speed +X%</h3><ul class="mt-md"><li>Not shown in the skill tooltip, but confirmed via testing.</li><li class="mt-sm">Has the same progression as the <i>Attack Speed +X%</i> bonus.</li><li class="mt-sm">Increases the <i>Execution Speed</i> of <a href="/combat-arts-influenced-by-tactics-lore/">combat arts influenced by Tactics Lore</a>.</li><li class="mt-sm">Stacks additively with other sources of <i>Execution Speed +X%</i>, like <i>Casting Speed +X%</i>.</li></ul><h3 class="mt-xl">Item Level without Penalty X</h3><ul class="mt-md"><li>Higher-level weapons (and shields) impose a penalty to the <i>Attack Speed</i> of basic attacks.</li><li class="mt-sm">They also impose a penalty to the <i>Execution Speed</i> of <a href="/combat-arts-influenced-by-tactics-lore/">combat arts influenced by Tactics Lore</a>.</li><ul class="mt-sm"><li>This penalty is half as much as the penalty to <i>Attack Speed</i>.</li></ul><li class="mt-sm">The higher the item level is above the character's, the more severe the penalties.<ul class="mt-sm"><li>The formula is: <code>Multiplier = MIN(1, ((CharacterLevel + 9) / (ItemLevel + 9))<sup>2</sup>)</code></li></ul></li><li class="mt-sm">This bonus increases the character's effective level (expressed as <var>X</var>) by 0.5 per skill point, thereby reducing the penalties.<ul class="mt-sm"><li>This does not affect the <a href="/game-mechanics/maximum-usable-item-level/">Maximum Usable Item Level</a>; characters still cannot equip items above this limit.</li></ul></li><li class="mt-sm">In the tooltip, <var>X</var> is rounded down and capped at <a href="/game-mechanics/maximum-usable-item-level/">Maximum Usable Item Level</a> minus 2.
