This factor is different for weapon attacks and for spells. Even if the character has 100% chance to inflict a secondary effect, at least 1 damage of that type must be dealt to the opponent. I don't know if the chance is determined one-sided, i.e. only based on the character's stats, or two-sided, i.e. after the opponent reduces the damage via armor, mitigation, etc.</p><p class="mt-md">When reapplying a secondary effect, the duration is reset.
