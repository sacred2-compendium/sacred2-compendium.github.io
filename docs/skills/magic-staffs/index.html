This behavior triggers automatically when the target is out of reach.</li><li class="mt-sm">These ranged attacks are still under the influence of this skill, not by <a href="/skills/ranged-weapons/">Ranged Weapons</a>.</li><li class="mt-sm">Some of the attack animations involve a sequence of two or three hits, but only one projectile will ever be fired.</li><li class="mt-sm">The attack animations themselves remain unchanged; the projectile is emitted at the end of the first attack in the sequence.</li><li class="mt-sm">The behavior described here is completely different in the <i>Community Patch</i> and other mods derived from it.</li></ul><h2 class="mt-xl">Skill bonuses</h2><h3 class="mt-xl">Attack Value +X</h3><ul class="mt-md"><li>Increases the character's base <i>Attack Value</i> by the listed amount.</li><li class="mt-sm">Stacks additively with other sources of <i>Attack Value +X</i>.</li></ul><h3 class="mt-xl">Attack Speed +X%</h3><ul class="mt-md"><li>Increases the <i>Attack Speed</i> of basic attacks.</li><li class="mt-sm">Stacks additively with other sources of <i>Attack Speed +X%</i>.</li></ul><h3 class="mt-xl">Execution Speed +X%</h3><ul class="mt-md"><li>Not shown in the skill tooltip, but confirmed via testing.</li><li class="mt-sm">Has the same progression as the <i>Attack Speed +X%</i> bonus.</li><li class="mt-sm">Increases the <i>Execution Speed</i> of <a href="/combat-arts/influenced-by-tactics-lore/">combat arts influenced by Tactics Lore</a>.</li><li class="mt-sm">Stacks additively with other sources of <i>Execution Speed +X%</i>, like <i>Casting Speed +X%</i>.</li></ul><h3 class="mt-xl">Item Level without Penalty X</h3><ul class="mt-md"><li>Higher-level weapons (and shields) impose a penalty to the <i>Attack Speed</i> of basic attacks.</li><li class="mt-sm">They also impose a penalty to the <i>Execution Speed</i> of <a href="/combat-arts/influenced-by-tactics-lore/">combat arts influenced by Tactics Lore</a>.</li><ul class="mt-sm"><li>This penalty is half as much as the penalty to <i>Attack Speed</i>.</li></ul><li class="mt-sm">The higher the item level is above the character's, the more severe the penalties.<ul class="mt-sm"><li>The formula is: <code>Multiplier = MIN(1, ((CharacterLevel + 9) / (ItemLevel + 9))<sup>2</sup>)</code></li></ul></li><li class="mt-sm">This bonus increases the character's effective level (expressed as <var>X</var>) by 0.5 per skill point, thereby reducing the penalties.<ul class="mt-sm"><li>This does not affect the <a href="/game-mechanics/maximum-usable-item-level/">Maximum Usable Item Level</a>; characters still cannot equip items above this limit.</li></ul></li><li class="mt-sm">In the tooltip, <var>X</var> is rounded down and capped at <a href="/game-mechanics/maximum-usable-item-level/">Maximum Usable Item Level</a> minus 2. Despite what the tooltip shows, <var>X</var> is not actually rounded down or capped.</li><li class="mt-sm">The reduction is applied only when a relevant weapon is equipped in the currently active weapon slot.</li><li class="mt-sm">When multiple weapons are equipped (e.g., <a href="/skills/dual-wield/">Dual Wield</a>) or a weapon and a shield are equipped, only the highest penalty among them is imposed; these penalties do not stack.</li><li class="mt-sm">Penalties from other sources, such as debuffs, stack additively with the penalty from equipped items.</li></ul><h3 class="mt-xl">Chance for Double Hit +X%</h3><ul class="mt-md"><li>This bonus relates to the chance of performing a special attack animation that involves an extra hit.<ul><li class="mt-sm">In the case of magic staffs, this means 2 hits instead of 1.</li></ul></li><li class="mt-sm">This special attack animation concerns only basic attacks and has a chance to occur even without the respective weapon skill.</li><li class="mt-sm">The skill simply increases the chance for it to occur. Skill mastery is not required, but it will raise the chance even further.</li><li class="mt-sm">Do not confuse with the item bonus <i>Chance for Double Hit +X%</i>.</li></ul><h2 class="mt-xl">Additional notes</h2><ul class="mt-md"><li class="mt-sm">One-handed magic staffs can be used in <a href="/skills/dual-wield/">Dual Wield</a> mode.<ul class="mt-sm"><li>When dual wielding, the bonuses from this skill are overriden by the ones from <a href="/skills/dual-wield/">Dual Wield</a>.</li></ul></li><li class="mt-sm">With the skill Magic Staffs, the behavior of basic attacks becomes as follows:<ul class="mt-sm"><li>When the target is up close, the staffs will be used as melee weapons.</li><li class="mt-sm">When the target is at a distance, the same attack animations will be performed, but only one projectile will ever be fired. The projectile is always fired using the right-hand weapon.</li></ul></li><li class="mt-sm">The skill Magic Staffs does not allow you to use <a href="/combat-arts/weapon-based/">weapon-based combat arts</a> from range, like ranged weapons do. However, weapon based combat arts that can target multiple opponents (through area-of-effect or automatic targeting) will be able to hit targets from extremely far away and do so instantaneously. This behavior is considered an exploit and has been fixed in the latest Community Patch and other popular mods.</li></ul><h2 class="mt-xl">Progression Table</h2><p class="mt-md"><a href="progression-table/">View the full table</a></p></div><div class="mt-md"><div><small><i><b>Note:</b> All values in this table are generated using reverse-engineered formulas based on observed in-game behavior.</i></small></div><table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Skill Level</th><th colspan="3" class="text-center">Pre-mastery</th><th colspan="4" class="text-center">Post-mastery</th></tr><tr><th>SkillValue</th><th>Attack Value</th><th>Attack Speed</th><th>SkillValue</th><th>Attack Value</th><th>Attack Speed</th><th>Chance for Double Hit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>99</td><td>+9</td><td>+1.9%</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>247</td><td>+24</td><td>+4.9%</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>75</td><td>1748</td><td>+174</td><td>+34.9%</td><td>1808</td><td>+180</td><td>+36.1%</td><td>+23.0%</td></tr><tr><td>200</td><td>2686</td><td>+268</td><td>+53.7%</td><td>3778</td><td>+377</td><td>+75.5%</td><td>+42.7%</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="text-container"><h2 class="mt-xl">Tooltip Values</h2><p class="mt-md"><small><b>Note:</b> The in-game tooltip values can be inaccurate or misleading.</small></p><p class="mt-md"><a href="tooltip-values/">View the full table</a></p><h2 class="mt-xl">Skill definition</h2><pre class="mt-md"><code style="display:block">mgr.createSkill {
